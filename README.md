# Anti Scam
A flood tool made for phishing/scamming websites making it harder for the receiver to determine which logins are real and fake.

# Information
Made this a while back and didn't bother making the repo. Make sure to gather the form data before running the src (where the information outputs). Won't work obviously work on websites that have CAPTCHA because the requests won't go through.
